# MACROKEYBOARD
Macro keys using AHK and luamacros!

Adapted from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arn8ExQ2Gjg (watch the video and read the description)
This repo contains my version of the .lua and .ahk files. Feel free to edit them! [make sure to replace 'PATH' in the .lua, .ahk files to your download path]

Features:
* The Keyboard attached can be protected by a password (currently the password is set to 'abcd' so replace it to your own choice)
* One can set modes and use the keyboard in various ways depending on the mode. It's as equivalent as to having a cockpit full of keyboards with tons of macro keys.
* 'Unlock' and 'lock' in order to or not to be able to change the mode using `Tab`
* The rest is just ahk performing simple functions when there's a key-press event from the macrokeys

Have fun!
