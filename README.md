# MACROKEYBOARD
Macro keys using AHK and luamacros!

Adapted from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arn8ExQ2Gjg (watch the video and read the description, setup "keyboardIdentifier" as shown by the video)

This repo contains my version of the .lua and .ahk files. Feel free to edit them! [make sure to replace 'PATH' in the .lua, .ahk files to your download path]

Extra Features:
* The Keyboard attached can be protected by a password (currently the password is set to 'abcd' so replace it to your own choice)
* One can set modes and use the keyboard in various ways depending on the mode. It's as equivalent as to having a cockpit full of keyboards with tons of macro keys.
* 'Unlock' and 'lock' in order to/not to be able to change the mode using `Tab` [from your 2nd keyboard]
* The rest is just ahk performing simple custom functions when there's a key-press event from the macrokeys.

Have fun!
